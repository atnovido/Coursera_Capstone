## A. Introduction


### A.1. Description & Disscusion of the Background
Road Accident is the most undesirable and unexpected thing to occur to a road user, though they happen quite often. Unfortunately, we can see a minatory rise of road accidents in Philippines, conspicuously highroad accidents over the past few years. It has a massive impact on society as well as in the economy of our country as there is an immense cost of fatalities and injuries. According to a recent report, annually on an average 9,000 lives have been taken by road accidents and lead to almost 28,000 injuries. This record indicates that every day, approximately 28 people were killed by road accidents and it is quite devastating. Besides this, according to WHO, the economic cost of road accidents to a developing country like us is 2-3% of GDP, which is a significant loss for a country like ours. Moreover, reducing this loss has become a great matter of concern for our country now.


### A.2. Data Description
For the accurate prediction of the severity of accidents, a considerable number of traffic accident records with full information is required to train by using the proposed approaches. In this research work, the authors have collected a dataset from the Traffic Bureau that consists of total 37,885 traffic accidents record from the year 2007-2017. The entire dataset will split into two parts- Training Dataset and Test Dataset. 70% of the whole dataset has been chosen randomly by using a python library as a training data set and the remaining 30% has been used as our test dataset. We have used the 70-30 ratio for splitting dataset because of its proven accuracy.


### B. Methodology
As a database, I used GitHub repository in my study. My master data which has the main components Borough, Average House Price, Latitude and Longitude informations of the city.


### C. Results
Letâ€™s merge those new variables with related cluster informations in our main master table.


You can now see Join, Labels and Level_labels columns as the last three ones in above table. You can also see a clustered map boroughs of Istanbul in the below.


### D. Discussion
As I mentioned before, Istanbul is a big city with a high population density in a narrow area. The total number of measurements and population densities of the 39 districts in total can vary. As there is such a complexity, very different approaches can be tried in clustering and classification studies. Moreover, it is obvious that not every classification method can yield the same high quality results for this metropol.


### F. Conclusion
As a result, people are turning to big cities to start a business or work. For this reason, people can achieve better outcomes through their access to the platforms where such information is provided. Not only for investors but also city managers can manage the city more regularly by using similar data analysis types or platforms.
