## A. Introduction


### A.1. Description & Disscusion of the Background

Road Accident is the most undesirable and unexpected thing to occur to a road user, though they happen quite often. Unfortunately, we can see a minatory rise of road accidents in Philippines, conspicuously highroad accidents over the past few years. It has a massive impact on society as well as in the economy of our country as there is an immense cost of fatalities and injuries. According to a recent report, annually on an average 9,000 lives have been taken by road accidents and lead to almost 28,000 injuries. This record indicates that every day, approximately 28 people were killed by road accidents and it is quite devastating. Besides this, according to WHO, the economic cost of road accidents to a developing country like us is 2-3% of GDP, which is a significant loss for a country like ours. Moreover, reducing this loss has become a great matter of concern for our country now.


### A.2. Data Description
To consider the problem we can list the datas as below:

I found the Second-level Administrative Divisions of the Turkey from Spatial Data Repository of NYU [2]. The .json file has coordinates of the all city of Turkey. I cleaned the data and reduced it to city of Istanbul where I used it to create choropleth map of Housing Sales Price Index of Istanbul.
I used Forsquare API to get the most common venues of given Borough of Istanbul [3].
There are not too many public datas related to demographic and social parameters for the city of Istanbul. Therefor you must set-up your own data tables in most cases. In this case, I collected latest per square meter Housing Sales Price (HSP) Averages for each Borough of Istanbul from housing retail web page [4].
I used Google Map, ‘Search Nearby’ option to get the center coordinates of the each Borough. [5].
